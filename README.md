Hellooo, 
This is my final project submission for CFG's Web Development Bootcamp ðŸŒŸ
It's my artist portfolio in it's most humble of forms:
Please view this simply as a draft as I have yet 
to master CSS and make responsive web designs!
You will find notes up and around my code to further
emphasis this is a work in progress. 
Any tips & tricks are welcomed!!
Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
